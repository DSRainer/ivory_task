[ Explore ] [ Enquire ]





INTRO
--------------------------------------------------


Not every gathering needs scale.

Some need intention.


Conclayve creates intimate, design-led experiences — from in-conversation formats and panel discussions to cocktail launches and private salons — crafted for the right audience, in the right 
setting.





PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------------------
The Power of the Room
We believe impact is created at the intersection of people, place, and purpose.
Every Conclayve experience is shaped around that intersection — thoughtfully, quietly, precisely.

THE “Y”

The Y Is the Moment

The pause before a conversation deepens.

The intersection where perspectives meet.

The reason people gather.


Conclayve is designed around that moment.


EXPERIENCES
--------------------------------------------------

In Conversation With…

Intimate dialogues with cultural leaders, creators, founders, and thinkers.


Panel Discussions

Editorially curated panels designed for insight, not noise.


Cocktail & Brand Launches

Atmosphere-led unveilings where storytelling leads.


Private Salons & Roundtables

Invite-only gatherings for leadership circles and premium communities.





SELECTED WORK
--------------------------------------------------
A Curated Body of Work

Stardust Awards — New York
--------------------------------------------------

An iconic celebration of cinema and culture, hosted at The Plaza Hotel, bringing together artists, industry leaders, and media on a global stage.


Society Achievers Talk Show — London
--------------------------------------------------

A distinguished cultural and leadership dialogue platform featuring Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar, set within an intimate, conversation-led format.


Asha Bhosle Live — USA Tour
--------------------------------------------------

A multi-city concert experience celebrating one of the most enduring voices in global music, curated for audiences across the United States.


Each experience informs the way Conclayve now curates intimate, design-led gatherings.



WHY THIS MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------

From Iconic Stages to Considered Conversations

Our experience across high-visibility, culturally significant platforms has shaped how we understand audiences, atmosphere, and flow.


Today, that legacy is distilled into smaller, more refined formats — where conversation leads, and impact lasts well beyond the evening.




THE CONCLAYVE DIFFERENCE
--------------------------------------------------


Curated audiences.

Design-led environments.

Editorial programming.

Understated production.


Nothing excessive.

Nothing accidental.

FOUNDER’S NOTE



Conclayve was shaped by our shared journey across cultural, media, and live entertainment platforms in multiple markets — and by a growing belief that the most meaningful moments don’t always happen 
on the biggest stages.


Through our involvement in iconic experiences such as the Stardust Awards in New York, international talk platforms in London, and live concert tours across the United States, we’ve seen how 
powerful a thoughtfully curated room can be. While scale brings visibility, intimacy creates connection — and connection is what lasts.


Conclayve is our response to that understanding.


We created Conclayve to design refined, invitation-only gatherings where conversation leads, audiences are intentional, and every detail serves a purpose. From in-conversation evenings and panel 
discussions to cocktail launches and private salons, each experience is crafted to feel considered, personal, and memorable.


At its heart, Conclayve is about bringing the right people together — and allowing the moment to unfold naturally.


— The Founders, Conclayve

Stallone , 

We are now looking to rebuild / elevate the Ivory Task website to reflect where the company truly stands today — as a full-fledged marketing and experiential company curating niche, high-impact 
platforms, not just executing events.

For creative and tonal reference, I’d like you to study the following two sites closely:

• https://www.gpj.com

That said, it is important that Ivory Task does not look like a version of either.
HOW IT SHOULD BE DISTINCT

While those agencies are global and broad, Ivory Task should feel:

    More curated

    More experiential-led

    More niche and culturally intelligent

    Strongly focused on experience, conversation, and impact

Our positioning should clearly communicate that:

    We curate experiences, conversations, and platforms

    We specialise in thoughtful, high-credibility events

    Our work sits at the intersection of marketing, culture, and civic dialogue

    We are selective, not volume-driven

When a stakeholder Opens our site, the immediate impression should be:

    “This is a serious, established company that knows how to curate important, niche experiences in New York and globally.”

DESIGN DIRECTION

    Clean, contemporary, minimal

    Strong typography and hierarchy

    Confident white space

    Editorial feel rather than sales-driven

    Motion / transitions can be subtle and dynamic, not flashy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
